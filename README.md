# StrokeAlert
Housed within this repository is a sophisticated stroke detection system comprised of two critical elements. The initial component involves an intricate data mining procedure, encompassing data visualization, thorough data cleansing, and intricate feature engineering, coupled with careful model selection and precise hyperparameter refinement. The subsequent component is a resilient system that utilizes personalized user features to predict potential occurrences of stroke, enabling prompt intervention and preemptive measures. Developed predominantly in Python, this system seamlessly incorporates vital libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn and pickle , to ensure seamless functionality and robust performance.
I also developed a user interface via streamlit to try a real interaction with the model
